                <p><b>Qualified Immunity</b> shields government officials from being sued for <b>violating
                        constitutional rights</b>,
                    unless those rights were "clearly established" at the time â€” an often <b>arbitrary standard</b>.
                    Because
                    courts can dismiss cases without ruling on whether rights were violated, the <b>law fails to

                            v. Fort Bend Independent School District</a></h4>
                    <p>A <b>7-year-old boy, a special education student</b>, was sent out of his class for being
                        disruptive. A
                        teacher stood in the hallway blocking the classroom door, and the little boy tried pushing past
                        her to re-enter the class. This <b>200+ lb. teacher slammed him to the floor and choked him for
                            over a minute, until bruises ringed his neck</b>. Because this type of excessive force had
                        never
                        been inflicted on a child by a teacher before, the parents of the boy were <b>unable to sue the
                            teacher or the school district</b>.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Police pursued a man into the basement of a house. They found him
                        <b>on his knees, with his hands over his head in surrender</b>. They <b>released a police dog on
                            him anyway and the man was torn apart</b>. Although a previous case deemed such wanton
                        brutality a 4th amendment violation,
                        the new case was <b>not similar enough</b>: Baxter had been on his knees,
                        whereas in the previous case, the suspect had been lying down before the dog was released on
                        him.
                        Thus, <b>qualified immunity protected the officer and the police department from a lawsuit</b>.

                    <p>A young couple brought their injured <b>baby</b> to the hospital. Nurses were concenred that
                        perhaps the
                        child had been abused, so <b>Child Protective Services</b> placed the baby in the custody of a

                        family. While in foster custody, the <b>baby was left face down on a pillow to suffocate and
